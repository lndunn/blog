# Golden

The `golden` data collection provides three months of continuous monitoring data from micro-PMUs installed during an early research deployment. Each PMU reports data at 120 frames per second on twelve channels: three-phase voltage and current, giving root-mean-square magnitude and phase angle for each.

The data includes nine micro-PMUs installed on two adjacent distribution feeders. PMU1 is sited at the substation and additional sensors are number sequentially based on their geographic distance from the substation. Note that electrical connectivity of the sensors may change over time due to changes in network configuration.
