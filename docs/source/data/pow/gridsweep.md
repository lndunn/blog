# GridSweep

The `GridSweep` collection includes data generated by a novel active probing device being developed to measure the grid's dynamic response to small perturbations. The data include 4kHz continuous point-on-wave measurements recorded during several intervals. 

Test data reported to date includes:
- 24-hours of continuous (passive) recording from a 120V wall outlet 
- 5 hours continuous recording in a laboratory testbed with both passive measurements and active probing. 

Source data and detailed documentation about tests performed may be found in the project's [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pe6WBQkCRDyOXNsVKfA-eW4_RjuJsOOB?usp=sharing) folder.
