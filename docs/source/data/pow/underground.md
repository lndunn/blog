This data collection reports 24-hours of three-phase continuous point-on-wave bus voltage and feeder current measurements on an 8kV XPLE underground cable. 

While much of the point-on-wave data generated today (e.g., by digital fault recorders) focuses on event-triggered snapshots of data, continuous monitoring data such as this provide a basis for enabling novel analytics establishing a baseline for what constitutes "normal" conditions on the grid. Advancing our understanding of these baseline conditions is central to improving visibility into anomalies, including known dynamics that may trigger DFR devices as well as dynamics indicative of latent issues that legacy event-triggered devices may not detected.
