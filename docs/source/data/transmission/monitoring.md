# Monitoring

The `monitoring` collection includes one week of time series measurements recorded at four different power generating stations. Generators include one grid-scale solar farm and three conventional generators.

The dataset can be used to study solar PV generation, including high-frequency dynamics or forecasting, or dynamic interactions between generators.

As with the `events` collection, the `monitoring` data is fully anonymized. Geographic and network data are intentionally omitted, time stamps are masked, and measurements are expressed in per unit notation.
