# gic/noaa

The `gic/noaa` data collection provides access to streaming data recorded by a magnetometer located on the ACE sattelite. Data are updated once per minute. Data can be correlated with `gic/usgs` data to build predictive models examining the time delay and extent of geomagnetic disturbances arising from activity. The data are provided in support of an NSF-funded study by NASA to build an alert system that would provide grid operators with advanced warning about solar activity that could be problematic for the grid.
