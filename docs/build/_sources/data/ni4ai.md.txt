# NI4AI Streaming Sensors

The `ni4ai` data collection provides open access to streaming data from a network of sensors deployed across the country as part of the project. 

The data captures 60 Hz voltage phasor measurements from microPMU sensors installed in wall outlets. Sensors are geographically distributed to achieve wide-area coverage of the grid.

A map of sensor deployment locations is provided below.
