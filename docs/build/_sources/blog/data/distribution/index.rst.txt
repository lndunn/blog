Distribution PMU Data
======================
   
Distribution PMUs stream time-synchronized measurements on distribution circuits. 

The main difference between transmission and distribution PMUs is that phase angle differences between measurement nodes on a distribution circuit are typically much smaller than phase angle differences that are characteristically seen in transmission networks, requiring much more precise time-synchronization than is needed for transmission PMUs.
