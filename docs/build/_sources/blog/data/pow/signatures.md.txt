# POW/Signatures

The `POW/signatures` collection provides access to point-on-wave measurements for upwards of 250 power quality disturbances reported in the DOE/EPRI National Database Repository of Power System Events. 

Each disturbance includes a 2-second snapshot of three-phase oscillography data for voltage and current, as well as neutral current. Each event signature also includes detailed metadata with labels obtained by post-mortem investigates into what triggered the event. Labels include the cause (e.g., lightning, transformer failure, etc.).

Additional documentation is available [here](https://pqmon.epri.com/).
