# Stream Data to NI4AI

On our data sets page, you'll see the `NI4AI` collection provides access to streaming measurement data from a network of sensors located across the country.

This data comes from members of the community who have installed sensors at work or at home. Most of these sensors are installed by simply plugging them into a wall outlet.

If you have a synchrophasor streaming data that you want to contribute to the project, please let us know by filling out the following google form.

We've included connection information, as well as metadata that will help users to put the data in context.

We can currently accept streaming PMU data via C37, GEP or STTP. Have a different protocol you'd like us to support? Just send us an email to issue the request.
