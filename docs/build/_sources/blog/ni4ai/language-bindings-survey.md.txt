# Language Bindings
At the core of the NI4AI PredictiveGrid platform is the BTrDB database - a timeseries database that has been designed from the ground up for dense or high volume telemetry analytics produced by sensors like syncrhophasors that monitor the grid. 

### What are bindings?

API interactions require _bindings_ &mdash; library code that allows you to connect to and query the database &mdash; to build applications and write analytics code. Currently we have language bindings in [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/BTrDB/btrdb), [Python](https://btrdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Julia](). However, to equip more people to access the platform we'd like to write bindings in the langauges that you use for analytics!

### Tell us what you need!

The survey allows you to submit your top three analytics langauges. The languages choices are those that have notebook kernels that are supported by Jupyter. If there is a language that has a notebook kernel that is missing, please [let us know!](mailto:support@ni4ai.org) The top three choices selected by our users will have langauge bindings implemented and documented throughout the course of the project.

This is one of the easiest ways to get involved with NI4AI and we're looking forward to hearing your thoughts!
