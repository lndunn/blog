# Voltage Sag Detection
*Mohini Bariya*

The tutorial describes an algorithm for detecting and analyzing voltage sags recorded in time series voltage measurements recorded by a distribution synchrophasor (a micro-PMU). The algorithm leverages the database structure of the Berkeley Tree Database (BTrDB) by querying summary statistics of measurements recorded across different time intervals to identify and narrow in on intervals during which voltage sags occurred. The algorithm discusses the implications and characteristics of voltage sags, as well as efficient methods for working with long time histories of data using BTrDB.
