*Dr. Kevin Jones*

This talk describe use cases and lessons learned from Kevin's experience building the synchrophasor data program at Dominion Energy. 
The program is founded upon the premise that making it fast and efficient to explore new use cases for PMU data will lead to the discovery of new use cases. 
The talk describes practical applications for PMU data that have been developed and deployed using PredictiveGrid.
