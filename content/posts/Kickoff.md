The National Infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence on the Electric Grid will be kicking off soon. You'll be able to sign up for access to the data we host, and use the PredictiveGridâ„¢ platform's tooling for visualization and analysis. Watch this space for more details. If you have questions, requests, or a data set that you'd like to make more widely available, you may get in touch with us directly at info@pingthings.io
